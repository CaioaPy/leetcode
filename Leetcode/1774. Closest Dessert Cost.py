#You would like to make dessert and are preparing to buy the ingredients. You have n ice cream base flavors
#and m types of toppings to choose from. You must follow these rules when making your dessert:

#There must be exactly one ice cream base.
#You can add one or more types of topping or have no toppings at all.
#There are at most two of each type of topping.
#You are given three inputs:

#baseCosts, an integer array of length n, where each baseCosts[i] represents the price of the ith ice cream base flavor.
#toppingCosts, an integer array of length m, where each toppingCosts[i] is the price of one of the ith topping.
#target, an integer representing your target price for dessert.
#You want to make a dessert with a total cost as close to target as possible.

#Return the closest possible cost of the dessert to target. If there are multiple, return the lower one.

#e.g.:
#Input: baseCosts = [1,7], toppingCosts = [3,4], target = 10
#Output: 10
#Explanation: Consider the following combination (all 0-indexed):
#- Choose base 1: cost 7
#- Take 1 of topping 0: cost 1 x 3 = 3
#- Take 0 of topping 1: cost 0 x 4 = 0
#Total: 7 + 3 + 0 = 10.
